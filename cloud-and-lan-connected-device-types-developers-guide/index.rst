Cloud and LAN Connected Developer's Guide
=========================================

Cloud and LAN connected devices are devices that use either a 3rd party service, like the Ecobee thermostat, or
communicate over the LAN (local area network) like the Sonos system. These devices require a unique implementation of
their device handlers. Cloud and LAN connected devices use a service manager SmartApp along with a device handler
for authentication, maintaining connections, and device communications. This guide will walk you through
service manager and device handler creation for both of these scenarios.
