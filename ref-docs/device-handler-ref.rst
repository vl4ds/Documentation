Device Handler
==============

Device Handlers, or Device Types, are the virtual representation of a physical device. They are created by creating a new *SmartDevice* in the IDE.

A Device Handler defines a `metadata()`_ method that defines the device's definition, UX information, as well as how it should behave in the IDE simulator.

A Device Handler typically also defines a `parse()`_ method that is responsible for transforming raw messages from the device into events for the SmartThings platform.

Device Handlers must also define methods for any supported commands, either through its supported capabilities, or device-specific commands.

For more information about the structure of Device Handlers, refer to the `Device Handler's Guide <../device-type-developers-guide/index.html>`__.

.. tip::

    Writing a Device Handler is considered a somewhat advanced topic. Understanding of how a Device Handler is organized and operates is assumed in this reference documentation. You should be familiar with the contents of the `Device Handler's Guide <../device-type-developers-guide/index.html>`__ to get the most out of this documentation.

----

Methods expected to be defined by Device Handlers:

<command name>()
----------------

.. note::

    This method is expected to be defined by Device Handlers.


The definition for a Command supported by this Device Handler. Every Command that a Device Handler supports, either through its capabilities or custom commands, must have a corresponding command method defined.

Commands are the things that a device can do. For example, the "Switch" capability defines the commands "on" and "off". Every Device that supports the "Switch" capability must define an implementation of these commands. This is done by defining methods with the name of the command. For example, ``def on() {}`` and ``def off()``.

The exact implementation of a command method will vary greatly depending upon the device. The command method is responsible for sending protocol and device-specific commands to the physical device.


**Signature:**
    ``Object <command name([arguments])>``

**Returns:**
    `Object`_ - Commands may return any object, but typically do not return anything since they perform some type of action.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

    metadata {
        // Automatically generated. Make future change here.
        definition (name: "CentraLite Switch", namespace: "smartthings",    author: "SmartThings") {
            ...
            capability "Switch"
            ...
    }
    ...
    // capability "Switch" declared, so all supported commands
    // of "Switch" must be implemented:
    def on() {
        // device-specific commands to turn the switch on
    }

    def off() {
        // device-specific commands to turn the switch off
    }
    ...

----

parse()
-------

.. note::

    This method is expected to be defined by Device Handlers.


Called when messages from a device are received from the hub. The parse method is responsible for interpreting those messages and returning :ref:`event_ref` definitions. Event definitions are maps that contain, at a minimum, name and value entries. They may also contain unit, displayText, displayed, isStateChange, and linkText entries if the default, automatically generated values of these event properties are to be overridden. See the `createEvent()`_ documentation for a description of these properties.

Because the ``parse()`` method is responsible for handling raw device messages, their implementations vary greatly across different device types.

The ``parse()`` method may return a map defining the :ref:`event_ref` to create and propagate through the SmartThings platform, or a list of events if multiple events should be created. It may also return a HubAction or list of HubAction objects in the case of LAN-connected devices.

**Signature:**
    ``Map parse(String description)``

    ``List<Map> parse(String description)``

    ``HubAction parse(String description)``

    ``List<HubAction> parse(String description)``


**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

    def parse(String description) {
        log.debug "Parse description $description"
        def name = null
        def value = null
        if (description?.startsWith("read attr -")) {
            def descMap = parseDescriptionAsMap(description)
            log.debug "Read attr: $description"
            if (descMap.cluster == "0006" && descMap.attrId == "0000") {
                name = "switch"
                value = descMap.value.endsWith("01") ? "on" : "off"
            } else {
                def reportValue = description.split(",").find {it.split(":")[0].trim() == "value"}?.split(":")[1].trim()
                name = "power"
                // assume 16 bit signed for encoding and power divisor is 10
                value = Integer.parseInt(reportValue, 16) / 10
            }
        } else if (description?.startsWith("on/off:")) {
            log.debug "Switch command"
            name = "switch"
            value = description?.endsWith(" 1") ? "on" : "off"
        }

        // createEvent returns a Map that defines an Event
        def result = createEvent(name: name, value: value)
        log.debug "Parse returned ${result?.descriptionText}"

        // returning the Event definition map creates an Event
        // in the SmartThings platform, and propagates it to
        // SmartApps subscribed to the device events.
        return result
    }

----

apiServerUrl()
--------------

Returns the URL of the server where this Device Handler can be reached for API calls, along with the specified path appended to it. Use this instead of hard-coding a URL to ensure that the correct server URL for this installed instance is returned.

**Signature:**
    ``String apiServerUrl(String path)``

**Parameters:**
    `String`_ ``path`` - the path to append to the URL

**Returns:**
    The URL of the server for this installed instance of the Device Handler.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

    // logs <server url>/my/path
    log.debug "apiServerUrl: ${apiServerUrl("/my/path")}"

    // The leading "/" will be added if you don't specify it
    // logs <server url>/my/path
    log.debug "apiServerUrl: ${apiServerUrl("my/path")}"

----

attribute()
-----------

Called within the `definition()`_ method to declare that this Device Handler supports an attribute not defined by any of its declared capabilities.

For any supported attribute, it is expected that the Device Handler creates and sends events with the name of the attribute in the `parse()`_ method.

**Signature:**
    ``void attribute(String attributeName, String attributeType [, List possibleValues])``

**Parameter:**
    `String`_ ``attributeName`` - the name of the attribute

    `String`_ ``attributeType`` - the type of the attribute. Available types are "string", "number", and "enum"

    `List`_ ``possibleValues`` *(optional)* - the possible values for this attribute. Only valid with the ``"enum"`` attributeType.

**Returns:**
    void

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

    metadata {
        definition (name: "Some Device Name", namespace: "somenamespace",
                    author: "Some Author") {
            capability "Switch"
            capability "Polling"
            capability "Refresh"

            // also support the attribute "myCustomAttriute" - not defined by supported capabilities.
            attribute "myCustomAttribute", "number"

            // enum attribute with possible values "light" and "dark"
            attribute "someOtherName", "enum", ["light", "dark"]
         }
         ...
    }

----

capability()
------------

Called in the `definition()`_ method to define that this device supports the specified capability.

.. important::

    Whatever commands and attributes defined by that capability should be implemented by the Device Handler. For example, the "Switch" capability specifies support for the "switch" attribute and the "on" and "off" commands - any Device Handler supporting the "Switch" capability must define methods for the commands, and support the "switch" attribute by creating the appropriate events (with the name of the attribute, e.g., "switch")

**Signature:**
    ``void capability(String capabilityName)``

**Parameters:**
    `String`_ ``capabilityName`` - the name of the capability. This is the long-form name of the Capability name, not the "preferences reference".

**Returns:**
    void

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

    metadata {
        definition (name: "Cerbco Light Switch", namespace: "lennyv62",
                    author: "Len Veil") {
            capability "Switch"
            ...
        }
        ...
    }

    def parse(description) {
        // handle device messages, determine what value of the event is
        return createEvent(name: "switch", value: someValue)
    }

    // need to define the on and off commands, since those
    // are supported by "Switch" capability
    def on() {
        ...
    }

    def off() {

    }

----

            // also support the attribute "myCustomCommand" - not defined by supported capabilities.
            command "myCustomCommand"

            // commands can take parameters
            command "myCustomCommandWithParams", ["string", "number"]

         }
         ...
    }

    def myCustomCommand() {

    }

----

createEvent()
-------------

Creates a Map that represents an :ref:`event_ref` object. Typically used in the `parse()`_ method to define Events for particular attributes.

    Property            Type        Description
    ================    =========== ===========
    name (required)     `String`_   the name of the event. Typically corresponds to an attribute name of a capability.
    value (required)    `Object`_   the value of the event. The value is stored as a string, but you can pass numbers or other objects.
    descriptionText     `String`_   the description of this event. This appears in the mobile application activity for the device. If not specified, this will be created using the event name and value.
    displayed           `Boolean`_  specify ``true`` to display this event in the mobile application activity feed, ``false`` to not display. Defaults to ``true``.
    linkText            `String`_   name of the event to show in the mobile application activity feed.
    isStateChange       `Boolean`_  specify ``true`` if this event caused a device attribute to change state. Typically not used, since it will be set automatically.
    unit                `String`_   a unit string, if desired. This will be used to create the ``descriptionText`` if it (the ``descriptionText`` option) is not specified.

        }
    }

----

reply()
-------

Called in the `simulator()`_ method to model the behavior of a physical device when a virtual instance of the device type is run in the IDE.

The simulator matches command strings generated by the device to those specified in the ``commandString`` argument of a reply method and, if a match is found, calls the device handler's parse method with the corresponding messageDescription.

For example, the reply method ``reply "2001FF,2502": "command: 2503, payload: FF"`` models the behavior of a physical Z-Wave switch in responding to an Basic Set command followed by a Switch Binary Get command. The result will be a call to the parse method with a Switch Binary Report command with a value of 255, i.e., the turning on of the switch. Modeling turn off would be done with the reply method ``reply "200100,2502": "command: 2503, payload: 00"``.

**Signature:**
    ``void reply(String commandString, String messageDescription)``

**Parameters:**
    `String`_ ``commandString`` - a String that represents the command.

    `String`_ ``messageDescription`` - a String that represents the message description.

**Returns:**
    void

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

     metadata {
        ...

        // simulator metadata
        simulator {
            // 'on' and 'off' will appear in the messages dropdown, and send
            // "on/off: 1 to the parse method"
            status "on": "on/off: 1"
            status "off": "on/off: 0"

            // simulate reply messages from the device
            reply "zcl on-off on": "on/off: 1"
            reply "zcl on-off off": "on/off: 0"
        }
        ...
    }

----

runEvery5Minutes()
------------------

Creates a recurring schedule that executes the specified ``handlerMethod`` every five minutes. Using this method will pick a random start time in the next five minutes, and run every five minutes after that.

**Signature:**
    ``void runEvery5Minutes(handlerMethod)``

----

runIn()
-------

Executes a specified ``handlerMethod`` after ``delaySeconds`` have elapsed.

**Signature:**
    ``void runIn(delayInSeconds, handlerMethod [, options])``

.. tip::

    It's important to note that we will attempt to run this method at this time, but cannot guarantee exact precision. We typically expect per-minute level granularity, so if using with values less than sixty seconds, your mileage will vary.

**Parameters:**
    ``delayInSeconds`` - The number of seconds to execute the ``handlerMethod`` after.

    ``handlerMethod`` - The method to call after ``delayInSeconds`` has passed. Can be a string or a reference to the method.

    ``options`` *(optional)* - A map of parameters. Currently only the value ``[overwrite: true/false]`` is supported. Normally, if within the time window betwen calling ``runIn()`` and the ``handlerMethod`` being called, if you call runIn(300, 'handlerMethod') method again we will stop the original schedule and just use the new one. In this case there is at most one schedule for the `handlerMethod`. However, if you were to call runIn(300, 'handlerMethod', [overwrite: false]), then we let the original schedule continue and also add a new one for another 5 minutes out. This could lead to many different schedules. If you are going to use this, be sure to handle multiple calls to the 'handlerMethod' method.

**Returns:**
    void

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

    runIn(300, myHandlerMethod)
    runIn(400, "myOtherHandlerMethod")

    def myHandlerMethod() {
        log.debug "handler method called"
    }

    def myOtherHandlerMethod() {
        log.debug "other handler method called"
    }

----

runOnce()
---------

Executes the ``handlerMethod`` once at the specified date and time.

**Signature:**
    ``void runOnce(dateTime, handlerMethod)``

**Parameters:**
    ``dateTime`` - When to execute the ``handlerMethod``. Can be either a `Date`_ object or an ISO-8601 date string. For example, ``new Date() + 1`` would run at the current time tomorrow, and ``"2017-07-04T12:00:00.000Z"`` would run at noon GMT on July 4th, 2017.

    ``handlerMethod`` - The method to execute at the specified ``dateTime``. This can be a reference to the method, or the method name as a string.

**Returns:**
    void

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

    // execute handler at 4 PM CST on October 21, 2015 (e.g., Back to the Future 2 Day!)
    runOnce("2015-10-21T16:00:00.000-0600", handler)

    def handler() {
        ...
    }

----

schedule()
----------

Creates a scheduled job that calls the ``handlerMethod`` once per day at the time specified, or according to a cron schedule.

    ``void schedule(dateTime, handlerMethod)``

    ``void schedule(cronExpression, handlerMethod)``

**Parameters:**

    ``dateTime`` - A `Date`_ object, an ISO-8601 formatted date time string.

    `String`_ ``cronExpression`` - A cron expression that specifies the schedule to execute on.

    ``handlerMethod`` - The method to call. This can be a reference to the method itself, or the method name as a string.

**Returns:**
    void

.. tip::

    Since calling ``schedule()`` with a dateTime argument creates a recurring scheduled job to execute *every day* at the specified time, the *date information is ignored. Only the time portion of the argument is used.*

.. tip::

    Full documentation for the cron expression format can be found in the `Quartz Cron Trigger Tutorial <http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.x/tutorials/crontrigger.html>`__

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

    preferences {
        section() {
            input "timeToRun", "time"
        }
    }

    ...
    // call handlerMethod1 at time specified by user input
    schedule(timeToRun, handlerMethod1)

    // call handlerMethod2 every day at 3:36 PM CST
    schedule("2015-01-09T15:36:00.000-0600", handlerMethod2)

    // execute handlerMethod3 every hour on the half hour (using a randomly chosen seconds field)
    schedule("12 30 * * * ?", handlerMethod3)
    ...

    def handlerMethod1() {...}
    def handlerMethod2() {...}
    def handlerMethod3() {...}

----

sendEvent()
-----------

Create and fire an :ref:`event_ref` . Typically a Device Handler will return the map returned from `createEvent()`_ , which will allow the platform to create and fire the event. In cases where you need to fire the event (outside of the `parse()`_ method), ``sendEvent()`` is used.

**Signature:**
    ``void sendEvent(Map properties)``

**Parameters:**
    `Map`_ ``properties`` - The properties of the event to create and send.

    Here are the available properties:

    ================    ===========
    Property            Description
    ================    ===========
    name (required)     `String`_ - The name of the event. Typically corresponds to an attribute name of a capability.
    value (required)    The value of the event. The value is stored as a string, but you can pass numbers or other objects.
    descriptionText     `String`_ - The description of this event. This appears in the mobile application activity for the device. If not specified, this will be created using the event name and value.
    displayed           Pass ``true`` to display this event in the mobile application activity feed, ``false`` to not display. Defaults to ``true``.
    linkText            `String`_ - Name of the event to show in the mobile application activity feed.
    isStateChange       ``true`` if this event caused a device attribute to change state. Typically not used, since it will be set automatically.
    unit                `String`_ - a unit string, if desired. This will be used to create the ``descriptionText`` if it (the ``descriptionText`` option) is not specified.
    data                A map of additional information to store with the event
    ================    ===========

.. tip::

    Not all event properties need to be specified. ID properties like ``deviceId`` and ``locationId`` are automatically set, as are properties like ``isStateChange``, ``displayed``, and ``linkText``.

**Returns:**
    void

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

    sendEvent(name: "temperature", value: 72, unit: "F")


----

            status "off": "on/off: 0"

            // simulate reply messages from the device
            reply "zcl on-off on": "on/off: 1"
            reply "zcl on-off off": "on/off: 0"
        }
        ...
    }

----

standardTile()
--------------

Called within the `tiles()`_ method to define a tile to display current state information. For example, to show that a switch is on or off, or that there is or is not motion.

**Signature:**
    ``void standardTile(String tileName, String attributeName [, Map options, Closure closure])``

**Returns:**
    void

**Parameters:**
    `String`_ ``tileName`` - the name of the tile. This is used to identify the tile when specifying the tile layout.

    `String`_ ``attributeName`` - the attribute this tile is associated with. Each tile is associated with an attribute of the device. The typical pattern is to prefix the attribute name with ``"device."`` - e.g., ``"device.water"``.

    `Map`_ ``options`` *(optional)* - Various options for this tile. Valid options are found in the table below:

    ======================== =========== ===========
    option                   type        description
    ======================== =========== ===========
    width                    `Integer`_  controls how wide the tile is. Default is 1.
    height                   `Integer`_  controls how tall this tile is. Default is 1.
    canChangeIcon            `Boolean`_  ``true`` to allow the user to pick their own icon. Defaults to ``false``.
    canChangeBackground      `Boolean`_  ``true`` to allow a user to choose their own background image for the tile. Defaults to ``false``.
    decoration               `String`_   specify ``"flat"`` for the tile to render without a ring.
    ======================== =========== ===========

    `Closure`_ ``closure`` *(optional)* - A closure that calls any `state()`_ methods to define how the tile should appear for various attribute values.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

    tile {
         standardTile("water", "device.water", width: 2, height: 2) {
            state "dry", icon:"st.alarm.water.dry", backgroundColor:"#ffffff"
            state "wet", icon:"st.alarm.water.wet", backgroundColor:"#53a7c0"
        }
    }

----

state
-----

A map of name/value pairs that a Device Handler can use to save and retrieve data across executions.

**Signature:**
    ``Map state``

**Returns:**
    `Map`_ - a map of name/value pairs.

.. code-block:: groovy

    state.count = 0
    state.count = state.count + 1

    log.debug "state.count: ${state.count}"

    // use array notation if you wish
    log.debug "state['count']: ${state['count']}"

    // you can store lists and maps to make more intersting structures
    state.listOfMaps = [[key1: "val1", bool1: true],
                        [otherKey: ["string1", "string2"]]]

.. warning::

    Though ``state`` can be treated as a map in most regards, certain convenience operations that you may be accustomed to in maps will not work with ``state``. For example, ``state.count++`` will not increment the count - use the longer form of ``state.count = state.count + 1``.

----

state()
-------

Called within any of the various tiles method's closure to define options to be used when the current value of the tile's attribute matches the value argument.

**Signature:**
    ``void state(stateName, Map options)``

**Parameters:**
    `String`_ ``stateName`` - the name of the attribute value for which to display this state for.

    `Map`_ ``options`` - a map that defines additional information for this state. The valid options are:

    ==================== =========== ===========
    option               type        description
    ==================== =========== ===========
    action               `String`_   the action to take when this tile is pressed. The form is <capabilityReference>.<command>.
    backgroundColor      `String`_   a hexadecimal color code to use for the background color. This has no effect if the tile has decoration: "flat".
    backgroundColors     `String`_   specify a list of maps of attribute values and colors. The mobile app will match and interpolate between these entries to select a color based on the value of the attribute.
    defaultState         `Boolean`_  specify true if this state should be the active state displayed for this tile.
    icon                 `String`_   the identifier of the icon to use for this state. You can view the icon options here.
    label                `String`_   the label for this state.
    ==================== =========== ===========

**Returns:**
    void

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

    ...
    standardTile("water", "device.water", width: 2, height: 2) {
        // when the "water" attribute has the value "dry", show the
        // specified icon and background color
        state "dry", icon:"st.alarm.water.dry", backgroundColor:"#ffffff"

        // when the "water" attribute has the value "wet", show the
        // specified icon and background color
        state "wet", icon:"st.alarm.water.wet", backgroundColor:"#53a7c0"
    }

    valueTile("temperature", "device.temperature", width: 2, height: 2) {
        state("temperature", label:'${currentValue}°',
            backgroundColors:[
                [value: 31, color: "#153591"],
                [value: 44, color: "#1e9cbb"],
                [value: 59, color: "#90d2a7"],
                [value: 74, color: "#44b621"],
                [value: 84, color: "#f1d801"],
                [value: 95, color: "#d04e00"],
                [value: 96, color: "#bc2323"]
            ]
        )
    }
    ...

----

status()
--------

The status method is called in the `simulator()`_ method, and populates the select box that appears under virtual devices in the IDE. Can be called in the `simulator()`_ method.

**Signature:**
    ``void status(String name, String messageDescription)``

**Parameters:**
    `String` ``name`` - any unique string and is used to refer to this status message in the select box.

    `String` ``messageDescription`` - should be a parseable message for this device type. It's passed to the device type handler's parse method when select box entry is sent in the simulator. For example, ``status "on": "command: 2003, payload: FF"`` will send a Z-Wave Basic Report command to the device handler's parse method when the on option is selected and sent.

**Returns:**
    void

**Example:**

.. code-block:: groovy

     metadata {
        ...

        // simulator metadata
        simulator {
            // 'on' and 'off' will appear in the messages dropdown, and send
            // "on/off: 1 to the parse method"
            status "on": "on/off: 1"
            status "off": "on/off: 0"

            // simulate reply messages from the device
            reply "zcl on-off on": "on/off: 1"
            reply "zcl on-off off": "on/off: 0"
        }
        ...
    }
