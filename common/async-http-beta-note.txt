.. admonition:: Beta Feature
   :class: beta-feature

   The ability to make asynchronous HTTP requests is currently available as a beta development feature.

   All beta asynchronous HTTP APIs exist in the ``asynchttp_v1`` :ref:`namespace <include_statement>`.
   Approximately 30 days after the launch of this beta feature, we will evaluate metrics and your feedback, and make adjustments as necessary.

   When released generally, it is likely that the ``v1`` postfix will be dropped, and a deprecation period will be announced to change existing usages accordingly.

   If, for unexpected reasons, usage of asynchronous HTTP requests has negative impacts on the SmartThings platform, SmartThings reserves the right to alter or remove any impacted asynchronous HTTP APIs without notice.
   This is highly unlikely and every effort will be made to avoid such a scenario.

   If you experience issues or have feedback on these asynchronous HTTP APIs, please share them on `this community thread <https://community.smartthings.com/t/asynchronous-http-beta-feedback-thread/60280>`__.
