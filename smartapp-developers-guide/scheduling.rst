Scheduling
==========

SmartApps and Device Handlers often need to schedule certain actions to take place at a given point in time.
For example, an app may want to turn off the lights five minutes after someone leaves.
Or, an app may want to turn on the lights every day at a certain time.

----

Overview
--------

Broadly speaking, there are a few different ways we might want to schedule something to happen:

- Do something after a certain duration of time from now.
- Do something once at a certain time in the future.
- Do something on a recurring schedule.

We'll look at each scenario in detail, and at the methods SmartThings makes available to address these requirements.

.. note::
    When using the scheduler APIs, the schedule will be created using the time zone of the SmartApp's location.

----

Schedule From Now - ``runIn()`` 
-------------------------------

A SmartApp may want to take some action within a certain duration of time after some event has occurred.
Consider a few examples:

- Turn a light off two minutes after a door closes.
- Adjust the thermostat ten minutes after everyone leaves.
- If a door opens and is not shut after five minutes, send a notification.

All these scenarios follow a common pattern: when a certain event happens, take some action after a given duration of time.
This can be accomplished this by using the :ref:`smartapp_run_in` method.

The ``runIn()`` method executes a specified handler method after a given number of seconds have elapsed. 

.. code-block:: groovy
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    def someEventHandler(evt) {
        // execute handler in five minutes from now
        runIn(60*5, handler)
    }

    def handler() {
        theswitch.off()
    }

By default, if a method is scheduled to run in the future, and then if another call to ``runIn()`` with the same method is made, the last one overwrites the previously scheduled method.
This is usually preferable.

Consider a situation where we have a switch scheduled to turn off after five minutes of a door closing:

- First, the door closes at 2:50 and we schedule the switch to turn off after five minutes (2:55).
- Then, two minutes later (2:52), the door opens and closes again - another call to ``runIn()`` will be made to schedule the switch to turn off in five minutes from now (2:57).

By default, there will now be *one* scheduled execution, at 2:57.
And in this scenario, that is preferable.

But if don't want the most recent scheduled handler to execute, we can specify ``[overwrite: false]``:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    def someEventHandler(evt) {
        runIn(300, handler, [overwrite: false])
    }

    def handler() {
        // need to handle multiple calls since overwrite:false specified
    }

We would now have two schedules to turn off the switch - one at 2:55, and one at 2:57.
So, if you do specify ``[overwrite: false]``, be sure to write your handler so that it can handle multiple calls.

.. note::

    It is important to note that you should not rely on ``runIn()`` being called in *exactly* the specified number of seconds.
    SmartThings will *attempt* to execute the method within a minute of the time specified, but cannot guarantee it.
    See the :ref:`limitations_best_practices` topic below for more information.

----

Run Once in the Future - ``runOnce()``
--------------------------------------

Some SmartApps may need to schedule certain actions to happen *once* at a specific time and date. :ref:`smartapp_run_once` handles this case.

You can pass a Date object or a Java ISO-8601 formatted string [1]_.

.. code-block:: groovy
    :emphasize-lines: 7,10

    preferences {
        input "executeTime", "time", title: "enter a time to execute every day"
    }

    def initialized() {
        // execute once at the time specified by the user
        runOnce(executeTime, handler)

        // execute tomorrow at the current time
        runOnce(new Date() + 1, handler)
    }


    def handler() {
        log.debug "handler executed at ${new Date()}"
    }

Like ``runIn()``, you can also specify the overwrite behavior of ``runOnce()``:

.. code-block:: groovy

    runOnce(new Date() + 1, handlerMethod, [overwrite: false])

----

Run on a Recurring Schedule - ``schedule()``
--------------------------------------------

Often, there is a need to schedule a job to run on a specific schedule.
For example, maybe you want to turn the lights off at 11 PM every night.
Or, you might need to execute a certain action every X minutes.

SmartThings provides the :ref:`smartapp_schedule` method to allow you to create recurring schedules.

The various ``schedule()`` methods follow a similar form - they take an argument representing the desired schedule, and the method to be called on this schedule.

.. note::

    If a method is already scheduled, and later you call ``schedule()`` with that method, then that method will be executed as per the new schedule.

Schedule Once Per Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``schedule()`` method to execute a handler method every day at a certain time:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :emphasize-lines: 6

    preferences {
        input "theTime", "time", title: "Time to execute every day"
    }

    def initialize() {
        schedule(theTime, handler)
    }

    // called every day at the time specified by the user
    def handler() {
        log.debug "handler called at ${new Date()}"
    }

You can also use ``schedule()`` with a Date object.
Only the time portion of the Date will be used to derive the schedule.

.. code-block:: groovy

    // execute every day at the current time
    schedule(new Date(), handler)

Finally, you can pass a Long representing the desired time in milliseconds (using `Unix time <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`__) to ``schedule()``:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    def someEventHandler(evt) {
        // call handlerMethod every day, at two minutes from the current time
        schedule(now() + 120000, handlerMethod)
    }

    def handlerMethod() {
        ...
    }

.. _schedule_using_cron:

Schedule Using Cron
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scheduling jobs to execute at a particular time is useful, but what if, for example, we want a method to execute at fifteen minutes past the hour, every hour? 
SmartThings allows you to pass a cron expression to the ``schedule()`` method to accomplish this.

.. code-block:: groovy
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    def initialize() {
        // execute handlerMethod every hour on the half hour.
        schedule("0 30 * * * ?", handlerMethod)
    }

    def handlerMethod() {
        ...
    }

A cron expression is a way to specify a recurring schedule, based on the UNIX cron tool.
The cron expression supported by SmartThings is a string of six or seven fields, separated by white space. 
The *seconds* field is the left most field.
The below table describes these fields. 

============ ================ ======== =================
Field        Allowed Values   Required Allowed Wildcards
============ ================ ======== =================
Seconds      0-59             Yes      \*  
Minutes      0-59             Yes      , - * /
Hours        0-23             Yes      , - * /
Day of Month 1-31             Yes      , - * ? / L W
Month        1-12 or JAN-DEC  Yes      , - * /
Day of Week  1-7 or SUN-SAT   Yes      , - * ? / L
Year         empty, 1970-2099 No       , - * /
============ ================ ======== =================

**Allowed Wildcards**

    - ``,`` (comma) is used to specify additional values. For example, SAT,SUN,MON in the Day of Week field means “the days Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.”
    - ``-`` (hyphen) is used to specify ranges. For example, ``5-7`` in the Hours field means “the hours 5, 6 and 7”.
    - ``*`` (asterisk) is used to specify all values in the field. For example, ``*`` in the Hours field means *every* hour.
    - ``?`` (question mark) is used to specify any value. For example, ``?`` in the Day of Week field means *regardless* of what the day of the week is.
    - ``/`` (forward slash) is used to specify increments. For example, ``5/15`` in the Minutes field means “the minutes 5, 20, 35, and 50”.
    - ``L`` is used to specify the last day of the month when used in the Day of Month field and the last day of the week when used in the Day of Week fields.
    - ``W`` is used to specify a weekday (Monday-Friday) that is nearest to the given day when used in the Day of Month field. For example, if you specify ``21W`` in the Day of Month field, it means: “the nearest weekday to the 21st of the month”. So if the 21st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 20th. If the 21st is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 22nd. If the 21st is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 21st. However if you specify ``1W`` as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, and not on Friday, as it will not cross over the boundary of a month. The ``W`` character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.

.. warning::

    You cannot specify both the *Day of Month* and the *Day of Week* fields in the same cron expression. 
    If you specifiy one of these fields, the other one must be ``?``.

Here is an example with the two fields, i.e., the *Day of Month* and the *Day of Week*. 
In the table below cases A and C are invalid.

====== ============ =========== ====================================================
Case   Day of Month Day of Week Cron Interpretation
====== ============ =========== ====================================================
A      `*`          MON         Every day of month *and* every Monday
B      `*`          ?           Every day of month *and* whatever be the day of week
C      23           `*`         Every 23rd of month *and* every day of week
D      ?            `*`         Whatever be the day of month *and* every day of week
====== ============ =========== ====================================================

We recommend that you test your cron expression before using it in a SmartApp or Device Handler.
The cron expression test tool we use is http://www.cronmaker.com/.

.. note::

    Cron jobs are only allowed to run at a rate of 1 minute or slower.
    If your cron expression runs faster than once per minute, it will be limited to a one minute interval.
    For more information, see this `community post`_.

    High volume cron schedules are encouraged to specify a random seconds field.
    This helps to avoid a large number of scheduled executions being queued up at the same time. If you can, use a random second.

Here are some common examples for recurring schedules using cron:

============================================= ===========
Expression Description                        Description
============================================= ===========
``schedule("12 30 * * * ?", handler)``         Execute ``handler()`` every hour on the half hour (using a randomly chosen seconds field of 12)
``schedule("23 0/7 * * * ?", handler)``        Execute ``handler()`` every 7 minutes beginning at 0 minutes after the hour (using a randomly chosen seconds field of 23)
``schedule("0 0/5 10-11 * * ?", handler)``    Execute ``handler()`` every 5 minutes beginning at 0 minutes after the hour, between the hours of 10 and 11 AM, at 0 seconds past the minute
``schedule("48 25 10 ? * MON-FRI", handler)``  Execute ``handler()`` at 10:25 AM Monday through Friday (using a randomly chosen seconds field of 48)
============================================= ===========

.. warning::

    Note how you use ``*`` as it may unwittingly lead to high-frequency schedules. 
    You may have intended to use ``?``. 
    Note the difference between ``*``, which means "every" and ``?``, which means "any". 

    For example, ``* */5 * * * ?`` means every 5th minute, run 60 times within that minute.
    That's almost surely not what you want, and SmartThings will not execute your schedule that frequently (see below).

    If you were trying to execute every X minutes, it would look like this: ``0 0/X * * * ?`` where X is the minute value.

Schedule Every X Minutes or Hours
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For common recurring schedules, SmartThings provides a few convenience APIs that we can use.
These methods use cron under the hood, but nevertheless will save you the effort of writing up the expressions themselves.

These methods work by creating a random start time in X minutes or hours, and then every X minutes or hours after that.
For example, ``runEvery5Minutes(handlerMethod)`` will execute ``handlerMethod()`` at a random time in the next five minutes, and then run every five minutes from then.

These methods have the advantage of randomizing the start time for schedules, which can reduce the load on the SmartThings cloud.
As such, these methods should be preferred over cron expressions when available.

The currently available methods are:

- :ref:`smartapp_run_every_5_minutes`
- :ref:`smartapp_run_every_10_minutes`
- :ref:`smartapp_run_every_15_minutes`
- :ref:`smartapp_run_every_30_minutes`
- :ref:`smartapp_run_every_1_hours`
- :ref:`smartapp_run_every_3_hours`

Using these methods is similar to other scheduling methods:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    def initialize() {
        runEvery5Minutes(handlerMethod)
    }

    def handlerMethod() {
        log.debug "handlerMethod called at ${new Date()}"
    }

----

.. _scheduling_passing_data:

Passing Data to the Handler Method
----------------------------------

Sometimes it is useful to pass data to the handler method.
This is possible by passing in a map as the last argument to the various schedule methods with ``data`` as the key and another map as the value.

.. code-block:: groovy
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    def someEventHandler(evt) {
        runIn(60, handler, [data: [flag: true]])
    }

    def handler(data) {
        if (data.flag) {
            theswitch.off()
        }
    }

By passing data directly to the handler method, you can avoid having to store data in the SmartApp or Device Handler state.
The following scheduling methods support passing data to their handler methods:

- ``runIn()``
- ``runOnce()``
- ``schedule()``
- All ``runEveryXMinutes()`` methods
- All ``runEveryXHours()`` methods

.. note::

    To also specify the overwrite flag, pass it as an additional property in the map: ``[overwrite: false, data: [foo: 'bar']]``.

Similar to state, :ref:`only data that can be serialized to JSON <state_what_can_be_stored>` can be passed to the handler.

The amount of data is limited to 2500 characters after being serialized.
If this limit is exceeded, a ``physicalgraph.exception.DataCharacterLimitExceededException`` exception will be thrown, and the schedule will not be created.

----

Removing Scheduled Executions
-----------------------------

You can remove scheduled executions using the :ref:`smartapp_unschedule` method:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :emphasize-lines: 8

    def initialize() {
        // schedule execution every 5 minutes
        runEvery5Minutes(handler)
    }

    def someEventHandler(evt) {
        // remove the scheduled execution
        unschedule(scheduledHandler)
    }

    def handler() {
        log.debug "in handler, current time is ${new Date()}"
    }

This will remove schedules created with any of the scheduling methods (``runIn()``, ``runOnce()``, and ``schedule()``).

You can also call ``unschedule()`` with no arguments to remove all schedules:

.. code-block:: groovy

    // remove all scheduled executions for this SmartApp install
    unschedule()

.. note::

    Due to the way that the scheduling service is currently implemented, ``unschedule()`` is a fairly expensive operation, and may take many seconds to execute.

----

Viewing Schedules in the IDE
----------------------------

You can view schedules for any installed SmartApp in the IDE.

.. note::
    Schedules can only be viewed for SmartApps installed via the mobile client.
    Schedules for Device Handlers and SmartApps installed via the IDE simulator can not be viewed.

1. In the IDE, navigate to `Locations`.
2. Select the Location the SmartApp is installed into.
3. Click the `List SmartApps` link:

.. image:: ../img/smartapps/view-installed-smartapps.png

4. Click the name of the SmartApp you wish to view the schedules for.

You will then see various information about the installed SmartApp, including the scheduled executions:

.. image:: ../img/smartapps/ide-scheduled-jobs.png

You can view all the scheduled jobs, including the next scheduled run time, the status, and the schedule.

You can also view the SmartApp job history, which shows the previous executions and the scheduled vs. actual execution time, the delay between the scheduled time and actual time, and the total execution time for the handler method:

.. image:: ../img/smartapps/ide-job-history.png

----

.. _limitations_best_practices:

Scheduling Limitations and Best Practices 
-----------------------------------------

When using any of the scheduling APIs, it's important to understand some limitations and best practices.

.. _scheduling_chained_run_in:

Avoid Chained ``runIn()`` Calls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use ``runIn()`` to schedule one-time executions, not recurring schedules.

For example, do **not** do this:

.. code-block:: groovy

    def initialize() {
        runIn(60, handler)
    }

    def handler() {
        // do something here

        // schedule to run again in one minute - this is an antipattern!
        runIn(60, handler)
    }

The above example uses a chained ``runIn()`` pattern to create a recurring schedule to execute every minute.

This pattern is prone to failure, because any single scheduled execution failure that results in ``handler()`` not being called means it will not be able to reschedule itself.
One failure causes the whole chain to collapse.

If you need a recurring schedule, use cron.

.. note::

    Using a chained ``runIn()`` pattern can be acceptable for certain short-running tasks, such as gradually dimming a bulb.
    But for anything long-running, use cron.


Execution Time May Not Be in Exact Seconds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SmartThings will try to execute your scheduled job at the specified time, but cannot guarantee it will execute at that exact moment.
As a general rule of thumb, you should expect that your job will be called within the minute of scheduled execution.
For example, if you schedule a job at 5:30:20 (20 seconds past 5:30) to execute in five minutes, we expect it to be executed at some point in the 5:35 minute.

Do Not Aggressively Schedule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every scheduled execution incurs a cost to launch the SmartApp, and counts against the :ref:`rate_limits`.
While there are some limitations in place to prevent excessive scheduling, it's important to note that excessive polling or scheduling is discouraged.
It is one of the items we look for when reviewing community-developed SmartApps or device-type handlers.

``unschedule()`` is Expensive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As discussed above, ``unschedule()`` is currently a potentially expensive operation.

We plan to address this in the near future. Until we do, be aware of the potential performance impacts of calling ``unschedule()``.

Note that when the SmartApp is uninstalled, all scheduled executions are removed - there is no need to call ``unschedule()`` in the ``uninstalled()`` method.

Number of Scheduled Executions Limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`smartapp_can_schedule` method returns false if four or more scheduled executions are created.

This currently does not actually impact the ability to create additional schedules, but such a limit may be imposed in the near future.
A community post will be made in advance of any such change.

----

Examples
--------

Here are some examples in the ``SmartThingsPublic`` repository that make use of schedules:

- Once-A-Day_ uses ``schedule()`` turn switches on and off every day at a specified time.
- Turn-It-On_ uses ``runIn()`` to turn a switch off after five minutes.
- Left-It-Open_ uses ``runIn()`` to see if a door has been left open for a specified number of minutes.

----

.. [1] You may notice that some of the scheduling APIs accept a string to represent the the date/time to be executed.
    This is a result of when you define a preference input of the "time" type, it uses a String representation of the value entered.
    When using this value later to set up a schedule, the APIs need to be able to handle this type of argument.
    When simply using the input from preferences, you don't need to know the details of the specific date format being used.
    But, if you wish to use the APIs with string inputs directly, you will need to understand their expected format.
    SmartThings uses the Java standard format of "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ". More technical readers may recognize this format as ISO-8601 (Java does not fully conform to this format, but it is very similar).
    Full discussion of this format is beyond the scope of this documentation, but a few examples may help:
    "January 09, 2015 3:50:32 GMT-6 (Central Standard Time)" converts to "2015-01-09T15:50:32.000-0600", and "February 09, 2015 3:50:32:254 GMT-6 (Central Standard Time)" converts to "2015-02-09T15:50:32.254-0600"
    For more information about date formatting, you can review the `SimpleDateFormat JavaDoc`_.
